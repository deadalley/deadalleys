    description: "PiPlane Tracker is a simple application for Raspberry Pi for tracking planes flying overhead your current position. The monitoring system emits a notification every time a plane is detected flying overhead and it keep tracks of all aircraft flying in your region. It works completely offline, requiring an ADS-B receiver to capture aircraft signals. It displays the flight number or ICAO code for the aircraft, its altitude and ground speed, and, if internet is available and HexDB integration is enabled, it also displays the aircraft model. It supports LCD and OLED displays for the notifications, otherwise the list of current flights is logged onto an interactive terminal. A sound notification is available either through an active buzzer or through a sound output (mp3)."
